Slack4Bruhveren/Slack4Bruhveren is a project for a community of like minded adults seeking support in times of need and during the times when people seem to develop less interest in a person's health and well being.
I started Bruhveren around December after I attempted to create a company called Slack that would have had the same m.o., but a hacker stole my name idea and thought I was mindless and butchered my ideas for the perfect company using my family name.
I have simply been attempting to learn new things to keep myself active and create a broad spectrum of capabilities associated with my "functionality as a human being" ever since and it has been night impossible, in fact BRUTAL just to be taken seriously.
If you are a person who complains at all and wishes they had someone just to vent to with the promise of feedback instead of silence, then you agree with my motive.
I do not complain often, but I'll explain why this is so important to me at a later date when I am less heated on this topic and more focused on the purpose of creating this content.
Thank you for your time.
